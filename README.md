- The problem that was being solved was the development of an advising assistance software for the Computer Science department at ABCU.
The goal was to create a C++ program  that efficiently manages course data, allowing academic advisors to load, view, and print information about Computer Science courses.
The software needed to implement a user-friendly menu system, load course data from a file into a specified data structure, provide the ability to print an alphanumeric list of courses,
and allow users to retrieve detailed information about specific courses, including prerequisites.

- Understanding data structures is crucial because they determine how information is organized and accessed, impacting the efficiency and performance of the software

- When facing roadblocks during the project, I leveraged problem-solving skills and sought assistance from online forums.

- This project has expanded my approach to designing software by emphasizing the importance of thorough planning and design before coding.
It highlighted the significance of creating modular and scalable code to accommodate future changes or additions. It also reinforced the importance of adhering to industry best practices,
such as incorporating error handling, meaningful naming conventions, and in-line comments, to enhance the overall quality and maintainability of the code.

- The experience has evolved my approach to writing programs in terms of maintainability, readability, and adaptability.
 I'll now place a greater emphasis on modular design, breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable components,
 and prioritize clear and descriptive variable and function names, along with comprehensive comments.
